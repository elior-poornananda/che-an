      Che’an is a mission-driven institute dedicated to the study of inner states
      and human alignment in the age of artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across cultures and centuries, humanity has sensed that clarity, peace,
      and right action arise from within — yet this inner world has remained
      deeply felt, rarely studied, and difficult to articulate.

  <!-- RESEARCH FOCUS -->
  <section class="section soft-bg">
    <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>

    <p>
      Grounded in deep respect for human experience, Che’an explores how
      <strong>voice, awareness, and reflection</strong> help individuals:
    </p>

    <ul class="focus-list">
      <li>Release emotional incompletion and inner fragmentation</li>
      <li>Stabilize their inner state and decision-making clarity</li>
      <li>Reconnect with agency, meaning, and conscious direction</li>
      <li>Manifest the life they are truly meant to live</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- INNER-STATE AI -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Inner-State AI™</h2>

    <p>
      Inner-State AI™ is Che’an’s foundational research framework — a new
      synthesis between human inner experience and artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not designed to replace human judgment, belief, or intuition.
      Instead, it serves as a reflective system — helping individuals hear,
      understand, and stabilize their own inner state with clarity and compassion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology, not as control — but as a mirror.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- BELIEF -->
  <section class="section soft-bg">
    <h2>What We Believe</h2>

    <ul class="beliefs">
      <li>Healing is not fixing — it is restoring inner coherence</li>
      <li>Awareness precedes choice, and choice shapes destiny</li>
      <li>Stable inner states naturally produce ethical action and meaningful success</li>
      <li>The next human evolution is not smarter machines, but clearer humans</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- COMMITMENT -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>

    <p>
      Che’an exists in service of humanity — across cultures, beliefs, and identities.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are committed to clarity over ideology, agency over dependence,
      presence over productivity, and truth over performance.
